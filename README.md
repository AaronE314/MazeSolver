# MazeSolver

A Program that Generates then solves a Maze

 The maze generation is the same as my MazeGenerator repository
 
 The solving is done with the random mouse algorithm
 
 This is a trivial method that can be implemented by a very unintelligent robot or perhaps a mouse. It is simply to proceed following the current passage until a junction is reached, and then to make a random decision about the next direction to follow, Then retreat back to the last intersection if the choice was a dead end. Although such a method would always eventually find the right solution, this algorithm will be extremely slow.
